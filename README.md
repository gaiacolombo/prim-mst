# MST solved with Prim's algorithm
Prim's algorithm implementation to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem for undirected, connected graphs with non-negative weights in both Prolog and Lisp progamming languages.
To fulfill this, it has been implemented a MinHeap (or MinPriorityQueue) data structure.

The API structure is described in the related programming language's folder.
