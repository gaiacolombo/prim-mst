# MST solved with Prim's algorithm

This project implements **Prim's algorithm** to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (**MST**) problem for undirected, connected graphs with non-negative weights. The algorithm is implemented in both Prolog and Lisp programming languages.
A **MinHeap** (or MinPriorityQueue) data structure has been developed to support this implementation.

The API structure is explained in the folders for each programming language.
